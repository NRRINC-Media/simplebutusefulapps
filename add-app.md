Your idea:
I have an App that Would help other people. How do i add it to Simple but useful?

1 App must work with Electron/Nodejs.
2 Must be able to run OFFLINE without issue.
3 No Ads.
4 You are allowed to use any item under the Apache v2 or the MIT license.
5 No crap. (Meaning if its there, dont make the idea, unless you can make it better)
6 You must have it De-compiled before Submitting a Pull request.


NPM packages that must be used
```shell
npm install nodejs
npm install electron
```
and for git:
```git
.gitignore

/electron/dist/electron
```
